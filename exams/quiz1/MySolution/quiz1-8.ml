 Question 8: 20 points
 Please give a NON-RECURSIVE implementation of sort5
 that takes 5 integers and returns a tuple that consists
 exactly of the 5 given integers ordered increasingly

 For instance, sort5(1, 2, 1, 2, 1) = (1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
 For instance, sort5(1, 3, 4, 5, 2) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 For instance, sort5(1, 3, 5, 4, 2) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

 You can implement your own helper functions as long as
 you do not make use of recursion.

let sort5: int*int*int*int*int -> int*int*int*int*int =
  fun(a,b,c,d,e) ->
   let swap x y = if x > y then y,x else x,y in
   let a,b = swap a b in
   let c,d = swap c d in
   let a,c = swap a c in
   let b,e = swap b e in 
   let b,c = swap b c in
   let d,e = swap d e in
   let c,d = swap c d in
   let b,c = swap b c in
   a, b, c, d, e
